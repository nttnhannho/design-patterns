# design-patterns
In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

In this project, I will make some sample codes to explains every single design pattern using Python programming language.
